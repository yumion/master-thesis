	outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the
	influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding
	that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse
	spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in
	overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results.
	The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT
	pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing
	over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations

@article{SURF,
	abstract = {This article presents a novel scale- and rotation-invariant detector and descriptor, coined SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features). SURF approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster.
	
	This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (specifically, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps.
	
	The paper encompasses a detailed description of the detector and descriptor and then explores the effects of the most important parameters. We conclude the article with SURFâs application to two challenging, yet converse goals: camera calibration as a special case of image registration, and object recognition. Our experiments underline SURFâs usefulness in a broad range of topics in computer vision.},
